### _Introduction_

The goal of this project is to create a simple and approachable asynchronous web server. At the lowest level it will make use of **epoll** on Linux based systems, and **kqueue** on FreeBSB based systems. As this is a learning experience for me, I make no commitments for performance.


The develop branch is for code that is currently in development and may be incomplete. Once a feature has been implemented it will be merged into master.
